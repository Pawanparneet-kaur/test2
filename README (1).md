**What are the key elements for this application?
Finding the hidden word is the purpose of the guessing game known as "hangman." The player's remaining chances decrease with each erroneous estimate. A hanging figure is used to symbolise the remaining opportunities. And saving lives is the duty of every hero.

**How would you manage these?
A fresh area of the falling man's body gets revealed after each misstep. We keep the body components in a list to put this into practise. After the player correctly guesses the entire word, the hangman escapes from the gallows in the final stage.


**Identify appropriate libraries and a toolstack. Think about how your choice of tools reflects the design. Can you avoid writing code (no code) or writing very little (low code)? Is this an entirely front-end application, back-end, or full-stack?
ts a full stack and we cannot do it without code because of we'll get something wrong in the implementation.
